            <p>Photography is something that everybody should know about, even just scratching the surface of it. Some things people don't realize is just how much the world as we know it has been impacted by photography and that is why i chose to research it and help the people know more about it. it is everywhere, in schools, on our phones, the places we walk in our neighborhoods, and so much more. The things that photography have done for the world are tremendous with things such as criminal investigations, forensics, research, scientific work, surgeries, telling stories, and the list forever goes on. The purpose of this project was just that, to help spread that awareness and understanding of what photography is and how important it is which many don't realize.</p>
            <p>Making this project was extremely difficult at times, and very hard to keep up with when you didn't want to, but in the end it was all worth it.  I had a lot of struggles at time especially with the CSS and making the website exactly how i envisioned it in my head.  Even looking back at it there are still things i would like to change and adjust, but i am overall very happy with what i made.  I learned a lot about myself and what i was capable of, and it helped me greatly.  I was able to advance my time management skills, my creativity skills, and so much more just from this process. </p>
